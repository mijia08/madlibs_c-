Dark * hunt by night,
While * rocks jump across,
* under stars
Kind * holding hands
In the warm, * daylight
* together.
My * is nice
Full of * energy
* in circles.
Flowers sit in *
Shade of the * trees near
* in sunset
When begins the *
And the crocus blooms
* anything
Enjoying * chocolate
With * joy
* in the warmth
The full * is here
As * as how I feel
* little talks, my dear
Reborn as a *
I now have a * life
* every day.
I have a new *.
This new job makes me *.
* folks daily.
*  is coming
Said by trees that's  *  the road
*  for the light
The * is alive, 
Do not wait, go now * 
* if you can
A lazy brown *
"* ipsum dolor sit!"
*, surely not
Waves crash on the *
why we are *
* waters reflecting it
Sitting on a *
A * bird flies past you
* out of fear
A river of *
Flows on * of clear and
* awareness
Computers are *,
they're very * and useful. 
* all computers!
Why is it called *
Their * trunk lift, greet
* from a tree
If * want to love
You should be a * one
* your heart up
Afternoon *
A *, odd pebble runs
* the ghost.
Boring break of *
A * dog finally
* at the plane
Polar *
A *, stark rose blossoms
* in spite of the snow
Thanksgiving *,
When * folk observe the
* of much thanks.
Colorful *
A little, * biscuit flies
* under the goldfish
Looking at a *
Flowers are in * bloom
* season
Where is my darn *?
This is my * problem.
* mad.
My * is missing
It went * away from me
* for freedom 
An endless *
With thorns * step
* to glory
The red autumn *
Falling through the * air
* the season
Cupcake awaits *
Haunted eyes * the dark
* away at night
In the beginning *
these big * people found
* tennis mascots.
Between * and there
Wispy clouds fill the * sky
* mares tails
Inclement *
then a little, * owl stalks
* the bee
The endless * comes
Darkness in their * eyes
* for new dawns
A bitter frigid *
How the * child, he trots
* through the fold
The cold winter *
what a * feeling
* it never ends
Small * dance in the park
In the cold, * nighttime
* endlessly.
The * is full of mystery
All around is * curiosity 
* in an endless timeloop.
